# Website Clone
## What I did
I made a clone of the blacklight-aquarium XD file. This was supposed to mimick a scenerio of a designer giving me design plans and having me make a static mock-up of the design. Open the .xd file and compare it to my mock-up!
## Previewing
The website can be previewed on github [pages](https://jpadillacoding.github.io./)
